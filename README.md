This project is a simple example of CRUD operations performed on a react applicaiton with Wordpress as its backend with RESTful API. The API allows us to edit Contact information. An Add button prompts a pop-up with a contact form. Each contact is arranged in an ascending order based on their first name. The contacts can be deleted, and updated as well. A search bar helps in navigating through the list using the first name as the identifiers. The back-end comprises of the headless wordpress, wherein each Contact gets added, updated or deleted as we perform each i=operation. Similarly, a MySQL database records the wp-posts from the Wordpress and edits the database accordingly.
